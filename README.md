# hanoi.py

A simple program which helps visualise a recursive solution to the well-known Tower of Hanoi game.
Implemented in Python but I definitely need to move to a HTML/CSS/JavaScript (still in the process of learning haha) platform, to allow greater flexibility in visualisation/general efficiency.
